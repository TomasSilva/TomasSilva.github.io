I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics at the [Institute of Mathematics, Statistics and Scientific Computing (IMECC)](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/en), [University of Campinas (UNICAMP)](https://www.unicamp.br/en), supervised by [Prof. Dr. Henrique N. Sá Earp](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/~hqsaearp/).

My work sits at the intersection of **geometry and computation**: I develop and apply **machine learning / AI** methods to problems in **Complex Differential Geometry** and **Algebraic Geometry**, aiming to turn geometric structure into practical numerical pipelines and new mathematical insight.

Before moving into mathematics, I completed a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at UNICAMP (2021) and worked as a junior researcher at the [Security and Cryptography Laboratory (LASCA)](https://www.lasca.ic.unicamp.br/) within the [Institute of Computing (IC)](https://ic.unicamp.br/en/), focusing on cryptanalysis of post-quantum and modern cryptographic systems.
