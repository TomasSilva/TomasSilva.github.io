## Outside Mathematics

Outside mathematics, I try to keep space for things that make me feel human. I write poetry — not with the ambition of publishing, but as a way of slowing down and paying attention. It helps me notice rhythm, silence, and nuance in ways that mathematics sometimes hides behind formalism. I also read constantly: literature, philosophy, essays, whatever expands perspective or challenges the way I see the world.

Boxing, on the other hand, gives me something entirely different. It demands presence, discipline, and resilience. There is no abstraction in a ring — only timing, breath, and focus.
