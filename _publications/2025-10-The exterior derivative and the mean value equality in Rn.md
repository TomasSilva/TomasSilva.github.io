This survey revisits classical results in vector calculus and analysis by exploring a
generalised perspective on the exterior derivative, interpreting it as a measure of
“infinitesimal flux”. This viewpoint leads to a higher-dimensional analogue of the
Mean Value Theorem, valid for differential \\(k\\)-forms, and provides a natural formulation of Stokes’ theorem that mirrors the exact hypotheses of the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus – without requiring full \\(C^1\\)  smoothness of the differential
form.
As a numerical application, we propose an algorithm for exterior differentiation
in \\(\mathbb{R}^n\\) that relies solely on black-box access to the differential form, offering a
practical tool for computation without the need for mesh discretization or explicit
symbolic expressions.
