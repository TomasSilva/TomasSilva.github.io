The combinatorics of dimer models on brane tilings describe a large class of four-dimensional \\(\mathcal{N}\\)=1 gauge theories that afford quiver descriptions and have toric moduli spaces. We introduce a combinatorial optimization method leveraging simulated annealing to explicitly construct geometrically consistent brane tilings, providing a proof of concept for efficient generation of gauge theories using metaheuristic techniques. The implementation of this idea recovers known examples and allows us to derive a new brane tiling with 26 quantum fields, illustrating the potential of metaheuristic techniques as a valuable addition to the toolbox for constructing and analyzing gauge theories from brane tilings.
