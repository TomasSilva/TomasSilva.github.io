We propose a machine learning approach to study topological quantities related to the Sasakian and \\(G_2\\)-geometries of contact Calabi--Yau \\(7\\)-manifolds. Specifically, we compute datasets for certain Sasakian Hodge numbers and for the Crowley--Nordström invariant of the natural \\(G_2\\)-structure of the \\(7\\)-dimensional link of a weighted projective Calabi--Yau \\(3\\)-fold hypersurface singularity, for \\(7549\\) of the \\(7555\\) possible \\(\\mathbb{P}^4(w)\\) projective spaces.

These topological quantities are then learned with high performance scores, where the Sasakian Hodge numbers are predicted from the \\(\\mathbb{P}^4(w)\\) weights alone using both neural networks and a symbolic regressor, achieving \\(R^2\\) scores of \\(0.969\\) and \\(0.993\\), respectively.

Additionally, properties of the respective Gröbner bases are well learned, leading to a vast improvement in computation speeds which may be of independent interest. The data generation and analysis further led to several novel conjectures.
